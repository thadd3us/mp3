Google Music is getting shut down. Booooo!

YouTube Music doesn't have many of the features I used in Google Music, including:

1.  Grouping by genre
1.  Easily searching for my OWN songs by artist or album.
1.  Even just browsing the music is a pain.
1.  You can't edit metadata anymore. 

I'm planning to migrate to something else, perhaps based on Google Drive to store my music,
but first, I wanted to organize it a bit.

Musicbrainz Picard is awesome for filling in missing metadata, but I couldn't get it to
rename my files to include the "genre" tag in the path, so I decided to write this, which is
also kind of nice for getting everything into a Pandas DataFrame.
